# Gif-Dance-Party

This Unity project is a little game that lets you load animated gifs from the web and place them on the dance floor before you.  It is currently limited so that you can only choose from a hardcoded list of 5 animated gif urls.  And it also also limited so that you everytime you hit the "Add Dancer!" button you can only add them to one of the defined spots marked by blue dots.

To start, hit the "+" button and you'll see a preview UI open that shows a dancing gif and 3 additional buttons.
The '<' and '>' buttons let you scroll through the other gif options.  The "Add Dancer!" button will add an instance of this dancer to the dance floor behind the preview.
